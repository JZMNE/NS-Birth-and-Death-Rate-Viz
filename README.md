# Nova Scotia Birth and Death Rate Visualization
This project visualizes birth and death rate data for the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. The data is sourced from Statistics Canada, and covers the years 2000 to 2019.

The aim of this project is to provide an easy-to-understand visualization of this data, allowing users to explore and compare birth and death rates over time. The visualization is designed to be accessible to a broad audience, and is optimized for viewing on desktop and mobile devices.
